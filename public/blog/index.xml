      <description>Blockchain ‚Äî and its associated technologies ‚Äî is set to play a key role in the evolution of Web 3.0, and the democratic decentralisation of data.
Web 1.0 ‚Äî The beginning Back in the 90s when the internet became a living breathing beast, we saw the birth of a new paradigm, a revolution in the form of information and communications.

After attending and participating in several APPG evidence meetings with a shared goal at governmental level to advance blockchain technology adoption we got an invite to Summer Reception by the chair of group Damien Moore MP.
So we boarded the train south as we love good chat with likeminded individuals plus there was a promise of the odd beer too üçª
A CryptoKaiju came along for the ride!</description>

      <description>How projects can leverage the latest scaling technologies to build highly scalable Ethereum applications
credits to district0x ‚Äî https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/
At BlockRocket we are often asked by clients, how can they can leverage public blockchains like Ethereum without suffering from known blockers such as scalability and transactions costs.
Today, the Ethereum ecosystem is maturing and scaling solutions, also known as layer 2 solutions (L2), are becoming production ready. We have been building with a variety of tools and frameworks that now allows us to advise our clients on the best approach right now on what can be realistically done and where we see this technology going.</description>
