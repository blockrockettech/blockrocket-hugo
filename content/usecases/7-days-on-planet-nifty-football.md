Nifty Football has been live on the main public Ethereum blockchain for just over a week and cards now exist in wallets all around the globe üåé

We have grown a new [Discord](https://discord.gg/GNKu46t) community in addition to the [Telegram](https://t.me/niftyfootball) following we already had. Join the conversation.

## Team Building

As new collectors purchase their first packs we are entering the **team building** phase as trading evolves as squads are formed collectors can see their best team and associated average. The greatest team in Nifty Football is **90 **currently owned by 0x3a2‚Ä¶8B6. [Check it out on the team share page](https://niftyfootball.cards/team/0x3a22282CBd2715E9D302B4A4AB0D6a117D8438B6)!

When the Champions League Final kicks off on the 1st June, the best and worst teams in the League will be awarded prizes.

### Best and Worst Team

Best team prize will get a custom shirt badge üìõ for each card in the top 11 plus one captain‚Äôs armband. Each player will have a number added to their shorts in their respective position (at the team owner‚Äôs discretion).

The worst team needs a little boost and we will give 11 credits in an attempt to help increase the team‚Äôs average. Each player will also get a new pair of boots in the colour preferred by the team manager so at least they will look decent on the park. üòÉ

As soon as packs were on sale we saw secondary activity immediately on sites such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/recent/niftyfootballtradingcard)

At time of writing we have had dozens of cards change hands on the secondary market including our most expensive player and current transfer record of **1 ETH**. American striker **Dylan Robinson** who has an average score of **93.**

## Blind packs

Over the coming weeks we will release more nationalities, kits, and colours and retire a couple from the blind packs (for now).
> On the 22nd May, 2 weeks after go-live, we will reduce the *base* on the generator functions by 5%. This is inline with our general policy to reward early adopters and ensures *genesis* cards and early token IDs will be generally be the stars of the Nifty Football universe.

We call all cards under token ID 100 are known as ‚Äú*Genesis Cards‚Äù. *These cards have a silver NFT FC badge on the front of the card.

All cards under 5000 (but greater than 1000) will be called ‚Äú*Origin Cards*‚Äù and come with a white badge on the front.

These early edition cards can and will can special meanings in the gameplay we are developing.
