### About the Project

BrewDog is a successful, global business with hundreds of outlets and thousands of retailers world wide.
Not only do they produce some of the finest craft beer and large on the planet, they are at eh cutting edge of customer engagement. 

We have been working with BrewDog over the last year to modernism their infrastructure, move to a cloud native software stack,
 decouple existing services and to fundamentally enable more agility within the business.  

We have delivered a suite of tools including scalable APIs, back office tooling and reporting solutions, data processing 
pipelines as well as integration with cutting edge layer 2 public blockchain technologies. 

### The Solution

Several solutions have been deployed to fulfil the requirements of BrewDog, below we cover the main components we have so far delivered. 

#### Cloud native architecture

* At the heart of the solution is the a move to cloud native services, rethinking how data and services work together.
* Tools such as AWS, Circle CI, Serverless as well as message queues and Cloud Databases have been used.
* Scalable and cost effective services which are decoupled, message driven now provide a backbone to the punk ecosystem.  

#### Scalable APIs

 * Underpinning the new service design is a set of NodeJS restful APIs which provides a layer of abstraction over several key 3rd party services, 
 providing a backbone for mobile applications, back office tooling as well as user authentication and data storage. 
* APIs are built on top of a Open API schema and provide secure, stateful authentication with common data access paradigms.

#### Customer loyalty and incentivisation

* At the core of BrewDog are its loyal and engaged customer based, from equity for punk investors to its highly engaged BrewDog user base. 
* All the changes made with an eye on how we can improve customer engagement, on how BrewDog can maintain a health ecosystem and rewarding them as they deserve. 
* We have leveraged a Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution to build and integrate a loyalty points platform to drive customer engagement. 
* Experimenting with crypto collectibles in the form of non-fungible tokens, NFTs, to issue badges and reward users in the form digital assets.    

#### Stock management and Reporting Dashboards 

* We have built a web based fullstack software solution, frontend and data driven dashboard providing insights in to operation issues.
* Integrating with the several third party data feeds providing up to date and accurate information on what is stocked in all brewDog stores.

### The Outcome

BrewDog is at the forefront of craft beer, the tooling we have developed enables new innovation, experimentation and helps the 
business react to changing needs and demands of its customers. 

The business now has up to date and accurate stocking and insights into activities on the ground.

New and existing applications have been migrated and built on top of the above toolset enabling further innovation.

Additional features and services can now also be plugged into existing data points, consuming data which was previous silod and difficult to access.

We continue to work closely with BrewDog, providing consultancy and engineering expertise to enhance their platform.
