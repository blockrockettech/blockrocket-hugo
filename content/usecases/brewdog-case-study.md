### About the Project

BrewDog is a successful, global business with hundreds of outlets and thousands of retailers world wide.
Not only do they produce some of the finest craft beer on the planet, they leverge cutting edge tools to drive innovation. 

We have been working with BrewDog over the last year to modernism existing infrastructure, 
move to a cloud native software stack with decouple existing services and to enable more agility within the business.  

We have delivered a suite of tools including Scalable APIs, back office tools and reporting solutions, data processing 
pipelines as well as integration with cutting edge layer 2 public blockchain technologies. 

### The Solution

Several solutions have been deployed to fulfil the requirements of BrewDog,
 below we cover the main components we have so far delivered 

#### Cloud native architecture

* At the heart of the solution is the a move to cloud native services, rethinking how data and services work together
* Tools such as Amazon Web Services, CircleCI, Serverless as well as message queues and Cloud Databases have been used
* Scalable and cost effective services which are decoupled and message driven now provide a new backbone  

#### Scalable APIs

* Underpinning the new service design is a set of NodeJS restful APIs providing abstractions over key services 
providing a backbone for mobile applications, back office tooling as well as user authentication and data storage. 
* APIs are built on top of a Open API schema and provide a secure, authenticated data access

#### Customer loyalty

* At the core of BrewDog are its loyal and engaged customer based 
* All the changes made with an eye on how we can improve customer engagement, maintaining a health ecosystem and rewarding users 
* Leveraging a Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, creating loyalty schemes through tokenisation 
* Experimenting with crypto collectibles in the form of non-fungible tokens    

#### Stock management 

* We have built web based solutions including frontend and data driven dashboard with operational insights
* Integration with several third party data feeds providing accuracy to in store stock levels and targets

### The Outcome

BrewDog is at the forefront of craft beer, the tooling we have developed enables new innovation, experimentation and helps the 
business react to changing needs and demands of its customers. 

New and existing applications have been migrated and built on top of the above toolset enabling further innovation.

Additional features and services can now also be plugged into existing data points, 
consuming data which was previous silod and difficult to access.

The business now has up to date and accurate stocking and insights into activities on the ground.

We continue to work closely with BrewDog, providing consultancy and engineering expertise to enhance their platform.
