### About the Project

BrewDog is a successful, Global business with hundreds of outlets and thousands of retailers world wide, not only 
that the produce some of the finest craft beer and large on the planet! 

We have been working with BrewDog over the last year to modernism their infrastructure, move to cloud native solutions,
 decouple services from stale expensive packaged solutions and to fundamentally enable more agility in the business.  

A suite of tools has been built and delivered include scalable APIs, back office tooling and reporting tools, data processing 
pipelines as well as integration with cutting edge layer 2 public blockchain loyalty and custom engagement platform. 

### The Solution

Several solutions have been deployed to fulfil the requirements of BrewDog, below we cover the main components we have delivered. 

#### Cloud native architecture

At the heart of the solution is the a move to cloud native services and a reimagining of how data and services work together with in the BrewDog ecosystem.

We leverage tools such as AWS, Circle CI, Serverless as well as message queueing and cloud DBs to facilitate this step change.

New services can quickly and easily plug in to existing data points, consuming data which was previous silod and difficult to get access to.

Providing a scalable and cost effective solution with decoupled services and message driven backbone.  

#### Scalable APIs

Underpinning the the new service design is a NodeJS restful API which provides a layer of abstraction over several 3rd party services and providing a backbone 
to the mobile applications, back office tooling as well as user authentication and data storage. 

The APIs are built on top of a Open API schemas and provides secure, stateful authentication with common restful data access paradigms.

New and existing applications have migrated and have been built on top of this layer enhancing the BrewDog ecosystem and enabling further innovation.

#### Customer loyalty and incentivisation

At the core of BrewDog are its loyal and engaged customer based. Along with this there are public investors and its highly engaged BrewDog for Punks user base. 

All the changes made have always had a eye on how to we can improve customer engagement, on how BrewDog can maintain a health ecosystem of users,
rewarding them as they deserve. 

We have been working with a Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution to build and integrate a loyalty points platform to drive customer engagement. 
Also looking to leverage crypto collectibles in the form of non-fungible tokens, NFTs, to issue badges and reward users in the form digital assets.    

#### Stock management and Reporting Dashboards

All businesses need to have up to date and accurate stocking and insights into activities on the ground. 

We have built a full stack application which integrates with the several third party data feeds providing up to date 
and accurate information on what is stocked in all brewDog stores.

### The Outcome

BrewDog is at the forefront of not only craft beer, the tooling we have developed enables new innovation, experimentation and helps the business 
react to changing needs and demands. 

We continue to work closely with BrewDog, providing consultancy and engineering expertise to enhance their platform.
