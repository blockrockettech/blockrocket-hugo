### About the Project

Cudo Ventures are a crypto focused innovative company building software and hardware solutions which leverage unused compute
 resources, driving new monetization and value creation mechanisms. 

Cudo approached BlockRocket to provide consultancy and engineering expertise for building applications on and with 
blockchain decentralised technologies.  

At BlockRocket we have a strong background in smart contract engineering which Cudo is leveraging to build outstanding products.

### Implementation

So far we have provided consultancy and delivered several decentralised applications for Cudo, some details below.

#### Token Contract (ERC-20)

* We have helped Cudo understand how to apply crypto-economic and tokenomic models in the real world 
* Building ERC-20 compliant smart contracts with full test coverage and audit friendly code base
* Embedding business and legislative rules within the token design as well as understanding
 how tokens can be used within the wider Cudo ecosystem

#### Staking Smart Contract (EIP-900)

* Helping Cudo understand the possibilities of token staking as well building out commonly used mechanisms for
 reducing token supply, user incentivisation and reward mechanics
* Delivering EIP-900 compliant smart contracts with full test coverage and audit friendly code base
* Merging additional crypto-economic models into the staking process and understand how staking works with Cudo compute

#### Token Vesting Smart Contract & Portal

* Creation of a fullstack solution including frontend and smart contracts to facilitate investor vesting schedules
* Design and delivery of custom token vesting rules embedded within smart contracts
* User friendly and secure user portal giving accessing to vested tokens   

### Outcome

Cudo is building innovative and cutting edge products which introduce new paradigms to existing infrastructure 
providers and users around the world.

We have been working throughout 2019 to help them realise these goals and vision, something we strongly believe in ourselves. 

We continue to work closely with Cudo, providing consultancy and engineering expertise to enhance their product suite.
