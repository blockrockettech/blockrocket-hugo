### About the Project

In April 2018 we launched a small popup art gallery with the goal to showcase the application of blockchain technology in the form of digital artwork tokenised on <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. 
Combining Art and Technology, both harnessing our passion for beauty and technology.  

The event was a success, demonstrating the power of smart contracts, tokenised artwork and public blockchains such as <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. 
It also demonstrated viability in the use of cryptocurrency as a method of value transfer between collectors and artists.

<a href="https://knownorigin.io/" target="_blank">KnownOrigin</a> is now a successful marketplace selling digital artwork as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), 
enabling hundreds of artists to monetize their work in a borderless, unstoppable world market, without intermediaries and free of cost. 

### Implementation

<a href="https://knownorigin.io/" target="_blank">KnownOrigin</a> is built using a suite of tools which leverage the very best in decentralised and web3 technologies, 
harnessing the power of the most popular and advanced public smart contract platform, <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>.

These technologies include amongst other things:

#### Smart Contracts in the Solidity language
 * Enforcing ownership, providing a mechanism for value transfer
 * Ensuring a chain of custody is maintained and provenance is public and visible
 * Enabling new forms of collaboration between artists 

#### IPFS (Interplanetary file system)
 * <a href="https://ipfs.io" target="_blank">IPFS</a> is used to host all data associated with the digital assets including images, names, descriptions
 * A peer-2-peer decentralised open network for sharing files

#### Blockchain UX patterns  
 * Blockchain UX is notoriously tricky, applying best practice UX and leveraging advanced tools such as Wallet Connect, BlockNative and TheGraph 
 * Mobile first responsive design, artwork is accessible and within reach of all

#### Data Caching and Cloud Native Infrastructure
 * Harnessing cloud infrastructure and data caching techniques improving user experience and facilitating advanced data analytics 
 * Cloud native DBs, serverless APIs and message processing allows the application to scale according to demand
     
### Outcome

Since launch, <a href="https://knownorigin.io/" target="_blank">KnownOrigin</a> has sold more than 5400+ pieces of art from over 170 digital artists around the world. 

Raising more than 280 ETH in sales revenue for artists - over $40,000.

With month on month growth, the traditional art world is taking note of the digital arts scene. 
Tokenisation of artwork placed on the <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> Blockchain seems to be a perfect solution to an age old problem. 

Since <a href="https://knownorigin.io/" target="_blank">KnownOrigin</a>, BlockRocket has now successfully built and delivered several NFT based solutions. 
Having this real-world experience, implementation and knowledge means others can leverage our experience and tools.
