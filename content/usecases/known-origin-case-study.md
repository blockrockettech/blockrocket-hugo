### About the Project

April 2017 we launched a small popup art gallery with the idea to showcase the application of blockchain technology in the form of tokenised digital artworks. 

The event was a success but more than anything it demonstrated the power of leveraging Smart Contracts, Public Blockchains such as Ethereum and using Cryptocurrency as a method of value transfer between collectors and artists.

KnownOrigin is a successful marketplace which issues digital artwork as non-fungible tokens, NFTs, allowing for hundreds of artists to monetize their work in a borderless, unstoppable world market with no intermediaries and free of cost. 

When a purchase is made all funds are instantly reconciled, at the point of sale, between creatives and collectors as well as providing a public and transparent chain of custody with ownership and provence enforced by the use of Smart Contracts.

### The Solution

KnownOrigin is built using a suite of tools which leverage the very best in decentralised and web3 technologies, harnessing the power of the most popular and advanced public Smart Contract platform, Ethereum.

These technologies include amongst other things:

#### Smart Contracts/Solidity
 * Enforcing ownership, providing a mechanism for value transfer, ensuring a chain of custody is maintained and provenance is public and visible to all those who look.
 * Experimentation with new form of auction models such as bonding supply to price as well as time.
 * Enabling new forms of collaboration between artists and enforcing settlement 

#### IPFS (Interplanetary file system)
 * This allows all data associated with the digital assets including images, names, descriptions and other items metadata which are artists name and Ethereum address to be distributed in a decentralised and permissionless fashion.

#### Blockchain UX patterns and Mobile first design  
 * Blockchain UX is notoriously tricky, we have applied best practice UX to smooth out this process and leverage advanced tooling such as Wallet Connect, BlockNative and The Graph. 
 * KnownOrigin works on all browsers and in all parts of the world. Artwork is easily accessible and within reach of the entire world's population.

#### Data Caching and Cloud Native Infrastructure
 * Blockchains are powerful beasts however they are do not do all things perfectly. 
 One thing they currently do not do so well is the ability to handle complex data queries . 
 We leverage cloud infrastructure ad databases to cache data from the Ethereum blockchain giving improved user experience and enabling more advanced data analysis. 
 * Cloud native DBs, Serverless APIs and message processing allows the application to scale according to demand and with fluctuations in traffic.

### The Outcome

Since lunch KnownOrigin has sold more than 5000 pieces of art from over 170 artists around the world. Raising more than 250 ETH in sales revenue for artists, approximately $40,000.

We see month of month growth and the traditional art market is taking note of the advancements in the digital art world, we see a long and prosperous future in tokenisation of artwork placed on the Ethereum Blockchain. 

BlockRocket has now successfully built and delivered several NFT based solutions and has the experience, tooling and knowledge to guy others through the same leaning process we have.
